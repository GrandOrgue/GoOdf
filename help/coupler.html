<h1>Couplers</h1>
<p>Couplers are used to allow a note played on on manual to play at
the same pitch on another manual, or at a pitch an octave higher or
lower on the same manual (intramanual) or other manuals
(intermanual), or to allow the normal pitch not to be played on the
same manual (Unison off.) This is configured by the coupler window.
Couplers can be controlled by Switches, generals, divisionals, and
GC. For more information on those parameters, see <a href="stop.html">Stops</a>.</p>

</p>
<p><b>UnisonOff </b>(Boolean, required) If true, this coupler
decouples the manual from the stops (turn it into a floating manual).
</p>
<p><b>Destination Manual</b> The manual to which the coupled key presses are sent.
</p>
<p><b>Destination Keyshift </b>(integer -24 - 24, required if not a
unison off coupler) specifies the keyboard shift between source and
destination manual in terms of absolute MIDI note numbers.
</p>
<p><b>Couple To Subsequent Unison Intermanual Couplers</b> (Boolean,
required if not a unison off/melody/bass coupler) Triggers further
inter-manual coupler with a destination key shift of zero. 
</p>
<p><b>Couple To Subsequent Upward Intermanual Couplers </b>(Boolean,
required if not a unison off/melody/bass coupler) Triggers further
inter-manual coupler with a destination key shift greater than zero. 
</p>
<p><b>Couple To Subsequent Downward Intermanual Couplers </b>(Boolean,
required if not a unison off/melody/bass coupler) Triggers further
inter-manual coupler with a destination key shift less than zero. 
</p>
<p><b>Couple To Subsequent Upward Intramanual Couplers </b>(Boolean,
required if not a unison off/melody/bass coupler) Triggers further
intramanual coupler with a destination key shift greater than zero. 
</p>
<p><b>Couple To Subsequent Downward Intramanual Couplers </b>(Boolean,
required if not a unison off/melody/bass coupler) Triggers further
intramanual coupler with a destination key shift less than zero. 
</p>
<p><b>Coupler Type </b>(enumeration, default: Normal) Type of the
coupler: Normal, Bass or Melody. Bass couples only the lowest note
being currently platy on the manual; Melody couples only the highest
note.</p>
<p><b>First MIDI Note Number </b>(integer 0-127, default: 0) first
MIDI note number to forward.
</p>
<p><b>Number Of Keys </b>(integer 0-127, default: 0) number of keys
to forward starting with FirstMIDINoteNumber.

<h1>Working with samples</h1>
<p>If you are concerned about your Organ GUI, it may be better to
define the stops or ranks, but not load samples until after the GUI
is complete and as you expect. This will allow GrandOrgue to quickly
load and display the GUI without loading any pipes. Of course, if
you’ve already loaded the pipes, then you can select <i>Don’t
Load </i>In
the GrandOrgue setting <b>Load
Stereo Samples in</b>:
pulldown to get the same behavior.</p>
<p>Samples are used to create one or more ranks. To import samples,
you first need to create a rank object (either internal to an already
defined stop, or external as an independent rank.) If you are only
importing one stereo attack sample per pipe or a stereo untremmed
sample and a tremmed sample, it is fine to use the rank internal to a
stop. For surround it is best to create a separate rank for each
sampled location, as this allows you to put them on separate
windchests to allow easy control of relative volume. Before beginning
make sure you have properly set the Location of the Organ file (top
line) in the [Organ] object.</p>
<p>Shown here is the GoOdf window when you create and select a rank</p>

</p>
<p>First Understand how your samples are organized. Then follow one
of the procedures below. (Read through all the procedures, since
steps performed in the first procedure are assumed in subsequent
procedures unless otherwise noted) :</p>
<h2>One sample per note</h2>
<p>In the easiest case there is only one sample per note, and the
release sample is included in the attack sample. The Midi note number
is contained in the sample name. In this case you would use the
following procedure:</p>
<p><img src="images/goodfhelp6_html_3d0a059d423f262b.png" name="Image6" align="left" width="160" height="397">
</img>
</p>
<p>Set the <b>First Midi Note</b> to the number in the name of the
sample. Typically 36, since this is normally the lowest note on a
keyboard, but sometimes it will be 24 if sub-octave samples are
included.</p>
<p>Set the <b>number of logical pipes</b> to the number of sample
files.</p>
<p>Leave <b>Percussive</b> and <b>Accepts Re-tuning</b>, in their
default state.</p>
<p>Set the <b>Harmonic number</b> to a value equal to 64/pitch
length. Thus for an eight foot stop, it is set to 8, for a 4’ stop
it is set to 16, for a 32 foot stop it is set to 2</p>
<p>make sure the <b>Load release in attack </b>check box is selected.</p>
<p>Click the <b>Create new pipes by midi nbr from…</b> button. A
window will pop up for you to select the directory with your samples.
Make sure this directory is in a relative location to the .organ file
you are going to create that will be its final location. Normally you
place the samples in a subdirectory of the
GrandOrgue/Organs/<i>organname</i>/ or in the /Organ
packages/<i>organnumber/ </i>.</p>
<p>When you select the directory and click open, you should then be
able to click the Expand the pipe tree button, and see the Attack(s)
populated with filenames.</p>
<h2>One sample per note with multiple release and
tremulant samples all in the same directory.</h2>
<p>A very common occurrence is to have a single attack sample, then
multiple separate release samples in subsidiary directories where the
directories are are named rel0180, rel0400, … , rel9999. There may
also be a subdirectory with tremulant samples.</p>
<p><img src="images/goodfhelp6_html_680dd68d6b22e6ab.png" name="Image7" align="left" width="175" height="319">

</p>
<p>In this scenarios repeat the steps above, but make sure the <b>Load
release in attack</b> check box is unchecked, and the Extract
<b>MaxKeyPressTime from foldername</b> checkbox is checked. Make sure
the <b>Release subfolder prefix</b> is
set correctly If there are tremulant samples make sure the
<b>Tremulant folder prefix</b> is
set correctly. Now when you press the <b>Create new pipes by
midi nbr from… </b>button, you
should see the pipes populated with an attack, and multiple releases,
or in the case of the existence of a Trem, two attack samples. (Be
wary of directories labeled ‘trem’ since many Hauptwerk sample
sets do not store the tremulant samples here, but instead a small
number of .wav files that define a simulated tremulant.)</p>
<p>When the samples are imported
you should be able to use the <b>Expand the pipe tree</b>
button and see that each pipe has
at least one normal attack, and a tremmed attack if there was a trem
directory. You should see multiple release files, both normal and
tremmed. You can right click on the pipeXXX to add more samples or on
individual samples to view or change their properties. Note that when
imported using this method the normal attacks and releases will show
‘Play when wave tremulant is off’ and the tremmed attack and
release samples will show ‘play when wave tremulant is on’ when
right clicking on the sample:</p>

<h2>Odd sample configurations</h2>
<p><img src="images/goodfhelp6_html_2f6333c9b507b278.png" name="Image9" align="left" width="117" height="334">
</img>
</p>
<p>Odd sample configurations occur when
release samples do not include the release time (they may, for
example have directories named S,M,L for short, medium, long.)
Tremmed samples may be in a completely different directory structure
rather than in a subdirectory under the non tremmed attacks. In these
sort of cases the samples must be imported and edited manually.
Typically this process begins by clearing the release and trem folder
prefixes in the rank window, then using the <b>Create new pipes by
MIDI nbr from…</b> button to import the non tremmed attack samples.
</p>
<p>Next import the three normal release
sample directories one by one using the <b>Add (only) releases from …</b>
button Next import the Tremulant attack samples by using the <b>Add
tremulant samples from…</b> button. Finally add the tremmed
releases one by one using the <b>Add (only) releases from… </b>button.</p>
<p>Your pipe tree should now look
something like this:</p>
<p><img src="images/goodfhelp6_html_bf4cb80c9e9ee987.png" name="Image10" align="left" width="323" height="418">
</img>
</p>
<p>You next need to edit the samples in
the pipe trees to correct their properties For example all the non
tremmed samples (attack and release)will be configured as ‘No, not
affected by wave tremulants’, and must be changed to ‘Play when
wave tremulant is off’.</p>
<p>While the tremmed attacks will be
properly configured as ‘play when wave tremulant is on’, the
tremmed releases will need to be changed to this</p>
<p>Finally, all the releases except the
longest will need to have their MAX key press time: value set. You
may need to guess at the correct number, or you may find it by
parsing any existing organ definition files that use these samples in
either GrandOrgue or Hauptwerk. There are open source programs to
look into the internals of both these ODF formats and allow easy
navigation to the data you want.</p>
<p>Some sample sets may employ
multiple attacks as well as releases. The attack sample is chosen
either by the velocity in the Midi message to the manual key
controlling that pipe, by the time since that note was last released,
or randomly. See <a href="pipe.html">Pipes</a> for more
information.</p>
<h2>Editing shortcuts</h2>

</p>
<p>The window above pops up when you right click on a release sample
in the expanded pipe tree. It is possible to change all the samples
from the same directory at once. You will see a grayed out button
called Copy properties to other releases (or attacks) from same
directory. Once you make a change and exit from the data entry box
this button will become active. When you press it it will apply your
changes not only to the selected release (or attack) sample, but also
to all the samples that were loaded from the same directory or
subdirectory.</p>
<h2>Borrowing Pipes</h2>
<p>In many organs there may be rank of pipes that includes enough
pipes for 16,8,and 4 foot stops. Alternatively, you may want to use
the same rank on multiple manuals. You can do this by defining a
single rank object with the full set of pipes, then reference the
proper subset of pipes from that rank in each stop that uses it.
Below we see the rank borrowed in the stop <i>Referenced Ranks</i>
tab. You can see we start with the 13<sup>th</sup> note in the rank,
borrow 61 pipes, and assign them starting with key 1 of the stop’s
associated manual:</p>
<p><img src="images/goodfhelp6_html_9c63f7a4d1928ebb.png" name="Image16" align="left" width="1260" height="934">
</img>
</p>
<p>However there is another way to borrow pipes that doesn’t need
external ranks. You can borrow from a rank internal to another stop
on the same or another manual. To do this, right click on Pipe001 of
the new stop and select Borrow pipe from the pop up menu. The
following window pops up allowing you to select the manual, the stop
within the manual, and the starting pipe and the number of pipes to
borrow</p>

</p>
<p>When you click create reference, the expanded pipe tree shows the
borrowed pipes, specifying in order, the manual number, the stop
number, and the pipe number:</p>

<h1>Pipes</h1>
<p>Pipes are found subsidiary to ranks or stops that load them. For
more information on loading pipes see working with samples.</p>
<p>Editing of pipes is done by right clicking an element in the
expanded pipe tree. For example if you right click on Pipe001, you
get a pop up window with the following options;</p>
<ul>
	<li>Add new attack from: pops up a window showing your directories so you can
	select a new (individual) attack sample (shortcut Ctrl+A)
	<li><p>Add new release from: pops 
	up a window showing your directories so you can select a new
	(individual) release sample (shortcut Ctrl+R)
	</p>
	<li>Borrow pipe: Pops up the following window
</ul>

</p>
<p>to let you borrow one or more pipes from another stop’s internal
ranks (shortcut Ctrl+B)</p>
<ul>
	<li>Copy this pipe offset to: pops up a dialog that allow to copy the selected
	pipe to other pipes with automatic pitch tuning offset calculation (within
	allowed range). (shortcut Ctrl+C)
	<li>Edit pipe properties: pops up this window, to allow editing
	of a single pipe’s parameters. (shortcut Ctrl+E)
</ul>

</p>
<ul>
	<li>Reset this pipe: removes all samples from the pipe and sets
	its attack back to DUMMY (shortcut Del)
</ul>
<p>The above mentioned pop up menu options can also be directly accessed by
using keyboard shortcuts when a pipe in the tree is selected.</p>
<p>Most of the parameters are discussed under <a href="rank.html">Rank</a>.
However there are a few new ones:</p>
<p><b>MIDI pitch Fraction </b>Overrides the number specified in the
wav file if this is not set to -1</p>
<p>If you right click on an attack sample you get the choice of
editing the attack sample properties or deleting the attack. If you
choose edit the following window pops up:</p>
<p><img src="images/goodfhelp20_html_37091e0af4f731a2.png" name="Image27" align="left" width="1228" height="664">
</img>
</p>
<p>Similarly when you right click on a release and choose edit, you
get the following similar window. 
</p>
<p><img src="images/goodfhelp20_html_8592c993c43c679e.png" name="Image28" align="left" width="962" height="487">

</p>
<p>Following the editing make sure you exit the edited box before
hitting the Exit button. If you make a change the ‘Copy properties
to other attacks(or releases)from the same directory’ becomes
active, so you can apply the changes to all the similar attacks or
releases in the pipe tree.</p>
<p>The following parameters are defined:</p>
<p><b>Max key press time</b> (int -1 - 100000, default: -1) Up to
this time value in ms, the release sample is chosen. -1 means
infinite. This is included in the attack sample
editing to control the key press time for the release contained in
the attack sample.</p>
<p><b>Attack Velocity </b>The
maximum velocity value in the note on message driving the key on the
manual to which this pipe is referenced to use this attack sample.</p>
<p><b>Max time since last release </b>(int
-1 - 100000, default: -1) maximum time since the last release of the
key to be able to use that attack. -1 means infinite. 
</p>
<p>(If <b>Attack Velocity</b>=0
and <b>Max time since last release</b> is
set to -1 the attack sample to use will be chosen randomly.)</p>
<p><b>Attack velocity</b> (int 0 - 127, default: 0) minimum velocity
to use this attack sample. (multiple attack samples can be specified
and chosen based on the velocity byte of the midi note on message
sent from hardware.)</p>
<p><b>Is Tremulant:</b> Choice of three settings:</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>No, not affected by wave tremulants:</i>
	<li><i>Play when wave tremulant is OFF</i>
	<li><i>Play when wave tremulant is ON</i>
</ul>
<p>this only applies to wave tremulants,
not synth tremulants for the windchest on which this pipe is mounted</p>
<p><b>Cuepoint position</b> and <b>Release end and Attack Start </b>(int
-1 - 158760000, default: -1) Allows to override the Start sample of
the release, the end sample of the release, and the start of the
attack. -1 means use from the wave file.
</p>
<p><b>Loop crossfade length </b>(int
0 - 3000, default: 0) Crossfade length in ms between loop start and
loop end. A crossfade requires enough samples before the start of
the loop. 
</p>
<p><b>Release crossfade length</b> (int 0 - 3000, default: 0)
Crossfade length in ms between loop and the release (or other
attacks). 0 means automatic selection/calculation. 
</p>
<p>You can also create your own loops in the attack samples – see
GrandOrgue help for more information.</p>

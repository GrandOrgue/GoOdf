<h1>Features</h1>
<p>With GoOdf you can: 
</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>Create organ description files (aka .organ files) for
	GrandOrgue without having to edit the large .organ text file
	manually.
	</p>
	<li><p>Load samples into the pipes of a rank/stop using MIDI number
	detection from directories and sub-directories of .wav files</p>
	<li><p>Easily create multiple panels conforming to the new panel
	format of GrandOrgue.</p>
	<li><p>Add GUI representations of ODF objects with ease, using
	standard Graphical elements already defined in GrandOrgue, or fully
	custom Graphical elements.</p>
	<li><p>Add additional graphic elements to panels such as Labels and
	Images, including custom graphics for each drawstop and manual key.</p>
	<li><p>See all the parameters associated with each object on a
	single window.</p>
	<li><p>See a hierarchical view of all objects on the left side of
	the GoOdf window (see screenshot below)</p>
	<li><p>Automatically keeps track of the number of subsidiary objects
	for each object being defined. 
	</p>
	<li><p>Object relationships are not always the same in GoOdf as in
	the .organ file. GoOdf hides these complexities and allows
	visibility of all objects that can be referenced by a second object
	in that second objects window.</p>
</ul>

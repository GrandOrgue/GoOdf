Creating Your Organ GUI</h1>
<p>To create a simple Organ GUI, using the main panel only, without
generals or divisionals, using graphical elements internal to
GrandOrgue you follow the following steps:</p>
<h2 class="western">Organize your manuals.</h2>
<p>You will have created manuals as objects earlier. For each manual,
edit its parameters:</p>
<p><b>Number of accessible keys</b> 32 for pedals and 61 for
manuals,, typically</p>
<p><b>MIDI input number</b> 1 for pedal, 2 for the first
manual(typically Choir or Great), and so on</p>
<p>You will have created enclosures, stops, couplers and tremulants.</p>
<p><font color="#000000">If you have a pedal, it must be the first
manual you create, and you must check the <b>This manual is the pedal</b>
box</font></p>
<h2 class="western">Create Panel details</h2>
<p>If you now click on the Main Panel object in the object tree at
the left of the GOODF window, you will see all of those elements in
the <b>Available Organ Elements</b> list. If you have a pedal click
the <b>Has Pedal</b> Yes Radio button. Then select all of the
available Organ Elements and click the <b>Create a GUI element of any
selected item above</b> button. Note that you can also create one or
more ODF Label GUI Elements useful for labeling drawstop columns or
creating A maker label for your organ GUI</p>
<p>You will then see the object tree populated with these new GUI
elements. If you click on any of these GUI elements the GOODF program
will show a window with all the available parameters for that GUI
object.</p>
<p>Before dealing with the individual GUI elements, we first need to
set the Main panel Displaymetrics, by clicking on that Item in the
object tree. You will see the following window:</p>
<p><img src="images/goodfhelp8_html_3a7ecb1c29e41d5d.png" name="Image14" align="left" width="1260" height="934" border="0"/>
<br clear="left"/>
</p>
<p>It is here that you set the size of your panel with <b>Horizontal
panelsize</b>, and <b>Vertical panelsize</b>. Also you use the
pulldowns to set the colors and patterns of wood used on the panel.
The pulldowns for the 5 different background areas of your panel show
numbers, but when you click on them they pull down images from which
you can select.</p>
<p>Most of the remaining parameters can be left as they are, unless
you are using custom Graphics. But it still remains to set up how
your stops knobs and buttons will be displayed</p>
<p>For drawstops the parameters do the following:</p>
<p><b>Drawstop columns </b>sets the number of columns available for
adding drawstops. Since these are distributed equally on each side of
the keyboards, it must be an even number. Columns are numbered from
the left</p>
<p><b>Drawstop rows </b>sets the number of rows. So if you have 50
such GUI elements to place in four columns, you need at least 50/4=13
rows. Rows are numbered from the top down</p>
<p><b>Pair Columns</b>, if set to yes groups columns 1,2; 3,4; etc
closer to each other with a wider gap between 2 and three. This is
useful when you are using two columns for one manual’s stops.</p>
<p><b>Drawstop Columns Offset</b> will offset the one column of a
pair half a row below a second column, as is often seen in large
organ consoles. With <b>Outer Up</b> ensures that this offset is such
that the outermost columns are offset up, that is, columns 1 and 4 if
4 columns are defined will be offset up. With <b>Outer Up </b><span style="font-weight: normal">set
to no, the inner column (2,3) are offset up.</span></p>
<p><b>Extra Drawstop</b> columns, allows you to enter the number of
drawstop columns you want above the manuals. Similarly for <b>Extra
Drawstop</b> Rows. The extra columns begin their numbering with 100.</p>
<p>Similar parameters are available to choose the rows and columns
for buttons, and to set the position of buttons relative to keyboards
and to extra stop rows.</p>
<p>You can set Default fonts here. The <b>Control Label Font</b> is
used for Stops, Tremulants, Switches, buttons, and couplers. The
<b>Group Label Font </b>is used for labels.</p>
<h2 class="western">Placing your elements.</h2>
<p>The manuals will organize their own position if you don’t change
their default parameters, which is what you want unless you are
creating your own manual graphics. The same is true for expression
elements. However The order of appearance of manuals is from the
bottom up, and they appear in the order in which you created their
GUI elements. Also make sure that the Panel has its <b>Has Pedal</b>
radio button properly configured.</p>
<p>What remains , then is placing Stops, Switches,
Tremulants,Couplers, Labels, and general and divisional buttons. <span style="font-weight: normal">At
the moment manuals appear from the bottom up in the order in which
you add their GUI element to the Panel. If you make a mistake you can
delete the manual GUI elements and re-add them in the correct order.
Note, if you have a Pedal, it must be added before the other manuals.</span></p>
<p>Remember as you are placing the elements that it is not enough to
enter a number or numbers in a data entry box, then click on the next
GUI element. You need to exit each data entry block with a tab or a
mouse click in order for the number to stick. If you don’t do this
you number won’t take, and you will find yourself doing lots of
rework.</p>
<h2 class="western">drawstops and buttons:</h2>
<p><font color="#000000">Each Stop, Switch, and Tremulant GUI element
is configured by clicking on it in the object tree at the left of the
GOODF window to bring up its parameter window which looks like this:</font></p>
<p><img src="images/goodfhelp8_html_7169ce2156d82140.png" name="Image15" align="left" width="1260" height="934" border="0"/>
<br clear="left"/>
</p>
<p><font color="#000000">The following parameters should usually be
changed:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><b>DisplayLabelText</b>: If you don’t
enter anything here the name of the Stop, Tremulant, or Switch
entered when you created it will automatically apply. You may however
want to add a different name, put the name in ALL CAPS, or add spaces
to allow a line break so that the name fits within the stop’s
DisplayImage.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><b>Labelfont: </b><span style="font-weight: normal">this
is a pulldown of all available fonts. You only need to specify if you
want a different font than you set as the </span><b>Control Label
Font</b> <span style="font-weight: normal">in the DisplayMetrics
window</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><b>DisplayLabelColour</b><span style="font-weight: normal">:
Select the colour for the text from the pulldown or select Custom
Color and then click on the color sample to the right to pop up a
color selector window. You can pick one of the predefined colors from
this window, or click on the + sign in this window to define a new
custom color which can then be selected. </span></font>
</p>
<p><font color="#000000"><b>DisplayImageNum</b><span style="font-weight: normal">:
This is a pulldown that shows the available Images built into
GrandOrgue for drawstops.</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><b>PositionY DisplayDrawstopRow</b> <span style="font-weight: normal">and
</span><b>DisplayDrawstopColumn</b> <span style="font-weight: normal">set
the Row and column for the drawstop. These are only active if
</span><b>PositionX </b><span style="font-weight: normal">and
</span><b>PositionY</b> <span style="font-weight: normal">are set to
-1. </span></font>
</p>
<p><font color="#000000"><span style="font-weight: normal">Custom
drawstops and locations are easy to create. At a minimum you need to
have an image for the stop being on, and an image for it off. You can
browse for these images. The dimensions for stops may need to be
changed to allow proper spacing of rows and columns. Also note that
if you want a custom location, you need to set </span><b>PositionX
</b><span style="font-weight: normal">and </span><b>PositionY</b> <span style="font-weight: normal">to
values other than -1.</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><span style="font-weight: normal">If your
custom drawstop images include the name of the stop, set
</span><b>TextBreakWidth</b> <span style="font-weight: normal">equal
to zero to keep your graphic from being overwritten by the
</span><b>DisplayLabelText.</b> <span style="font-weight: normal">Otherwise
this parameter sets the maximum length of text for a drawstop before
it is wrapped to the next line</span></font></p>
<h2 class="western">Labels</h2>
<p><font color="#000000"><span style="font-weight: normal">You can
use labels to add an Organ Name label, or to label the stop columns
with the manual they are controlling. To that end, the Labels can be
positioned at the top or bottom of the Columns by setting </span><b>Free
X pos</b> <span style="font-weight: normal">and </span><b>Free Y pos</b>
<span style="font-weight: normal">to no. This enables the
</span><b>DispDrawstopCo</b><span style="font-weight: normal">l data
entry, to select the stop column; the </span><b>At top of drawstop
columns</b> <span style="font-weight: normal">to select top or bottom
location; and </span><b>Span Column to right</b><span style="font-weight: normal">,
if you have paired drawstop columns and you want the label centered
above two paired columns.</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><b>DispImageNum</b> <span style="font-weight: normal">is
a pulldown that shows the built in label graphics from GrandOrgue.
Note that if you select one the </span><b>Width</b> <span style="font-weight: normal">and
</span><b>Height</b> <span style="font-weight: normal">boxes are
filled in with the correct number of pixels. Some labels are bigger
than others in one or more dimensions. You can also specify your own
image for a label and manually set its position, the same as you
could for the control elements in the Panel's</span> <span style="font-weight: normal">Displaymetrics
window.</span></font></p>

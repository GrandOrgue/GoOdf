<h1>Enclosures</h1>
<p>Enclosures change the volume of ranks mounted on a windchestgroup
which references that enclosure.</p>
<p>The main parameter associated with an enclosure is <b>Amplitude
Minimum Level </b>(integer 0-100, required) volume, if the enclosure
is closed. The units are linear amplitude , not dB.</p>
<p>It's also possible to set the MIDIInputNumber so that the enclosure can be
automatically connected to what an user has set as initial MIDI configuration
in GrandOrgue.</p>

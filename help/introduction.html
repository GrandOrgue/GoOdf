Introduction</h1>
<p>This page provides a brief description of the objects that define
an ODF. For more information on how to use these objects see the
<a href="gettingstarted.html">Getting Started </a>page. Objects are
separated into functional objects, GUI objects, and pipes.</p>
<h2 class="western">Functional objects</h2>
<p>GOODF creates and organizes objects to create a .organ file that
can be loaded by GrandOrgue. The objects appear in a tree view on the
left side of the GOODF window as shown in the picture:</p>
<p><img src="images/goodfhelp3_html_be5e16cd930f637f.png" name="Image2" align="left" width="206" height="561">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>The following bullets describe the available objects and their
relationship to one another. There are also links to a complete
description of all the parameters associated with each object:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p><a href="organ.html">Organ</a>: The Organ is the top level
	object and there can only be one per .organ file. All other objects
	fall under Organ.</p>
	<li><p><a href="manual.html">Manuals</a>: The Manuals are created
	for each keyboard (including the Pedal Clavier). Stops, Couplers,
	and Divisional objects are created as subsidiary objects to the
	manual. The manual references Switches and Tremulants that are
	associated with it so that Divisionals can control these Switches
	and Tremulants.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p><a href="stop.html">Stops </a>are Objects that turn on or
		off ranks of pipes. They can either act directly or be controlled
		by switches. Stops can have an internal Rank of pipe samples, or
		can reference one or more external ranks.</p>
		<li><p><a href="coupler.html">Couplers </a>take key presses on the
		Keyboard they are associated with and forward them to another
		keyboard at the same pitch, or a higher or a lower pitch. They can
		also forward key presses to the same keyboard or disable their own
		keyboard with a ‘Unison Off’ function. Couplers either act
		directly or can be controlled by switches</p>
		<li><p><a href="divisional.html">Divisionals</a> are memory storage
		elements, typically part of a combination action to store and
		recall the on/off state of each stop, coupler, tremulant, and
		switch associated with or referenced by the manual under which it
		is defined.</p>
	</ul>
	<li><p><a href="windchest.html">Windchestgroups</a> are an analogy
	to the chest that real pipes are mounted on. Each Rank associates
	itself with a windchestgroup. Each windchestgroup references one or
	more Tremulants or expression Enclosures.</p>
	<li><p><a href="enclosure.html">Enclosures</a> are a mechanism to to
	change the volume, and in some cases the high frequencies of the
	pipes mounted on a windchestgroup. Enclosures are referenced by one
	or more windchestgroups. Enclosures are controlled by Swell Pedals
	or sliders added to a Panel.</p>
	<li><p><a href="tremulant.html#12.Tremulants%7Coutline">Tremulants</a>
	are a mechanism to introduce a slow periodic variation in pitch and
	amplitude to the sound of a rank of pipes. Tremulants are referenced
	by windchestgroups and by manuals.</p>
	<li><p><a href="rank.html">Ranks</a> are collections of pipes with
	the same sound. Ranks are not directly controlled, but can be
	referenced by stops. Ranks can also be defined within a stop as
	subsidiary to it.</p>
	<li><p><a href="#20.Pipes|outline">Pipes</a> are the individual
	sound samples used to create a rank. Pipes are referenced by ranks,
	and can include attack samples, release samples, and tremulant
	samples. Some editing of individual and group of pipe sample
	parameters can be had by right clicking in the expanded pipe tree.
	See <a href="usinggoodf.html#5.Using%20GoODF%7Coutline">Using GOODF</a>
	for more information on working with samples</p>
	<li><p><a href="switch.html">Switches</a> are objects used to
	control other objects using combinational logic. Switches can be
	made visible so they appear to the user as stop knobs and can be
	referenced by tremulants, manuals, and stops. See <a href="usinggoodf.html">Using
	GOODF</a> for more information on why and how to use switches.</p>
	<li><p><a href="reversible.html">Reversible Pistons</a> are like
	Divisionals or Generals, but they behave as binary latches. Press it
	once to activate, then press again to deactivate. Reversible pistons
	reference one instance of a stop, coupler, Switch, or Tremulant. If
	it references a stop or a coupler it must also reference a manual,
	but GOODF takes care of the manual reference Automatically.</p>
	<li><p><a href="divcouplers.html">Divisional Coupler</a> is an
	object which when active allows a Divisional on one manual to
	activate the Corresponding Divisional on the other referenced
	manuals. The Divisional coupler references one or more manuals.</p>
	<li><p><a href="general.html">Generals</a> are memory storage
	elements that are like divisionals, except they can apply their
	action to the whole organ, not just one Manual. As such they are not
	referenced by nor do they reference a manual. They can reference
	stops, couplers, tremulants, and switches.</p>
</ul>
<h2 class="western">GUI Elements</h2>
<p>GUI objects can be created from many of the functional objects
above and displayed on one or more panels. GUI objects can use
graphical elements built into the GrandOrgue software, or can use
images you create yourself. Thus for example, custom keyboards,
pedals, Stop knobs, and sliders or expression pedals can be created.
For more information on how to create GUI Objects and Panels, see
<a href="creatinggui.html">Creating your Organ GUI.</a></p>
<p>Available GUI objects are as follows:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p><a href="panel.html">Panel</a> refers to an independent
	window that can be opened or closed from the GrandOrgue main
	application window’s Panel menu. At a minimum, a Main panel is
	required. Often other panels with, for example, left and right side
	stop knob arrays are also created. A functional object can be
	represented by a GUI object on more than one panel. Since GrandOrgue
	includes many default panels, for example for couplers, generals,
	Divisionals, the number you may wish to create will usually be
	limited.</p>
	<li><p>By clicking on the Main Panel entry, Available Organ Elements
	and Available Setter elements can be selected to create <a href="element.html">GUI
	elements.</a> Available Organ elements are the Objects such as
	manuals, stops, tremulants, switches, and enclosures that you
	created. Available Setter elements are objects predefined in
	GrandOrgue that can be placed on panels as GUI elements. Of
	particular import if you are using generals or divisionals, are the
	Set element and the GC (general cancel) elements. Once you have
	selected an element, and clicked “create a GUI element of any
	selected element above” you will see a new GUI element appear in
	the list at the left</p>
	<p>Different types of element have different parameters. For
	example, for keyboards and pedals you can choose a few variations of
	standard displays. For enclosures, you can pick one of several
	predefined swell pedals, and for stops and generals, several styles
	of predefined knobs and buttons.</p>
	<p>You can also define your own GUI element appearance using your
	own images. For example, you may want an enclosure to appear as a
	slider rather than as a swell pedal. In that case a series of bitmap
	images are referenced, one for each of the up to 127 positions for
	the enclosure object. 
	</p>
	<li><p><a href="image.html">Images</a> are separate GUI elements
	that can be placed on the panel.</p>
	<li><p><a href="label.html">Labels</a> are separate GUI elements
	that can be placed on the panel</p>
</ul>
<p><br/>

</p>
<h2 class="western"><a name="20.Pipes|outline"></a>Pipes</h2>
<p>Each rank object (either internal to a stop, or separately
defined) references one or more pipes. Each pipe has one or more .wav
file samples associated with it. Alternatively A pipe in a rank can
borrow one or more pipes from another stop (or more correctly from a
rank internally defined by a stop object). It cannot borrow from
another rank. 
</p>
<p>Pipe samples are generally stored in a directory structure with
each sample labeled with its midi note number. In this case these
samples can easily be associated with the pipes in a rank by telling
GOODF to look in the proper directory on your computer. Samples have
the following variations:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>attack samples include the initial transient when a pipe
	receives wind, as well as a sustain section defined by a loop which
	continues as long as the pipe is sounding</p>
	<li><p>One or more release samples include the transient sound of
	the pipe when air is cut off, as well as the reverberation of the
	room in which the sample is taken. In simple sample sets the release
	sample is included in the attack .wav file. In more complicated
	sample sets two or more sub-directories will define multiple release
	samples. The sample to be used depends on how long the manual key
	operating the pipe is held down</p>
	<li><p>Tremulant samples may be available which sample the same pipe
	with its tremulant engaged. Tremulant samples will include their own
	sets of releases.</p>
	<li><p>Many sample sets now come in surround sound where pipes are
	sampled at different positions in the room, for example, direct,
	near, and far samples. Suggestions for how to deal with these are
	found in the Using<a href="usinggoodf.html"> GOODF section</a>. More
	information can be found in <a href="pipe.html">pipes</a>.</p>
</ul>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>Recording and preparing the sample files is outside the scope of
GOODF. However other software to assist with this is available, as
are web based tutorials on the sampling process, noise reduction, and
adding loop and release markers.</p>

<h1>Using GOODF</h1>
<p>To create an organ is a process that requires some planning. This
section begins with some recommendations for how to plan and
implement your organ, then links to other pages describing the
processes involved in using GOODF to create a complete .organ file</p>
<h2>Planning your Organ</h2>
<p>You will probably want to use GOODF to create GrandOrgue versions
of existing Hauptwerk organs, or to combine sample sets from multiple
Hauptwerk or GrandOrgue sample sets into a custom organ. In that case
you will have a directory structure for the samples and graphical
elements already in place. Spend time understanding the structure of
the existing organ(s). If you are starting with your own samples, you
will want to create your directory structure to conform to the GOODF
standards: Each rank has an attack directory, and includes release
sample sub-directories <i>relXXXXX</i>. If there are separate tremmed
samples their will also be a <i>trem</i>
subdirectory with its own attack samples and relXXXXX
sub-directories. (XXXXX refers to the time in milliseconds that is
the maximum time a key is held down to use that release
subdirectory.) Of Course, it is possible to take pre-existing sample
sets with different directory structures and re-create the preferred
structure by renaming directories and/or creating symbolic links,
according to the features of your chosen operating system.</p>
<h2>Samples and sharing</h2>
<p>When planning your Organ you will want to think about how to use
your available pipe samples. For example, if you want a large organ
operating on a computer with limited RAM, you may want to consider
multiplexing and duplexing (making the same pipe samples available at
multiple pitches and on multiple keyboards. If you are doing this you
need to recognize that by sharing ranks or borrowing pipes, you give
up the ability to adjust pitch or volume separately. If you change
these in the Rank where the samples are loaded, they will also change
in every other stop that uses or borrows from that rank.</p>
<p>You can have more samples than there are keys on a keyboard, so
that when super or sub octave couplers are used these extra samples
will allow notes to be heard over the entire keyboard rant</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, you have lots of memory and want
flexibility, it is possible to load the same samples into multiple
ranks. For More information see <a href="workingwithsamples.html">Working
with samples</a>, which also includes instructions for creating
ranks.</p>
<h2>Windchestgroups</h2>
<p>Next think about which ranks should be associated with which
windchestgroup. Since Tremulants and enclosures are applied to a
specific windchestgroup, the ranks which use the tremulant and the
enclosure need to be on that windchestgroup. For example, on a simple
two manual Organ, there may be two windchestgroups, where the Great
and Pedal rank are on one windchestgroup without an enclosure and
tremulant, but the Swell ranks are on a separate windchestgroup with
both. You can make the windchestgroups more complex if, for example,
you want some or all of the pedal ranks to be in enclosures, but not
influenced by a tremulant. Finally, added windchestgroups with
multiple enclosures per windchestgroup may be used to allow
adjustment of the volume of surround sound samples, even if you
choose in GrandOrgue only to have stereo output</p>
<p>For more information see <a href="usingwindchests.html">Using
Windchests</a></p>
<h2>Manuals</h2>
<p>Next think about how many manuals you will need, and how you want
to configure them. You can define names for them, and change the
number of keys. For example, many samples sets are created for 54
note keyboards. Manuals can have more logical keys than accessible
keys so that Ranks with more pipes than keyboard keys will sound
their extra pipes when a manual super (GT to GT 4) or Sub (GT to GT
16) intramanual coupler is activated.</p>
<p>For More information on defining manuals see the help for the
manual object.</p>
<h2>Switches</h2>
<p>Switches are elements used to perform combinational logic.
Switches Can appear on the GUI looking like stops and are referenced
by a manual. Two examples will illustrate the use of switches:</p>
<h3>Multiple switches to activate a stop</h3>
<p>Suppose you want to implement a feature such as having a single
drawstop to turn all the reed stops on on one or more manuals. Assume
the reeds in Question, are a Bombarde 16, Trumpet 8, Clairon4, and
Zink2. You would create the following objects:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>Stops for the four reeds above</p>
	<li><p>A switch for each of the four reeds labeled with the Name of
	the reed stop</p>
	<li><p>A switch labeled REEDS ON.</p>
</ul>
<p>All the switches have their <b>Function</b> (pulldown below the
name) left at the default INPUT. This indicates that the value of the
Switch comes from control of its GUI element.</p>
<p>You would then create GUI elements for the five switches you have
created, and reference them from the manual with which they are
associated.</p>
<p>For each of the four reed stops, you do not create GUI elements,
and you set them up with the Function equal to <i>And. </i>For
the Bombarde 16 stop, for example, you Select Reference the Bombarde
16 switch and the REEDS ON switch. Thereafter the Bombarde 16 stop
will become active only when the Bombarde 16 switch <i>AND</i>
the
REEDS ON Switch GUI elements are both active:</p>
<h3>Switch activating multiple stops:</h3>
<p>You may want to
create a switch to activate multiple stops. For example you may have
a stop which plays a rank of pipes, and another stop that plays a
percussive noise to simulate the mechanical sound of a drawstop being
drawn and a third stop that plays a mechanical sound when the
drawstop is de-activated. A Switch with a GUI element may be used to
activate both of these stops . The stop which plays a rank references
this switch with its function set to OR or AND. A single pipe stop
with the Drawstop drawn noise also references the switch with the
function set to OR or AND. The stop which plays the noise of the
drawstop being de-activated references the same switch with its
function set to not. (It appears that stops with only one pipe, and
no releases do not need a note on a keyboard to be pressed to
activate a sound)</p>
<h2>GUI</h2>
<p>Finally consider the Graphical user interface you with to
implement. This depends on a lot of factors, like how you intend to
use your organ, if you might want to share it with others, and what
resources you have to make a visually appealing interface. You can
start with a simple GUI until you get your organ working, and then
consider making it progressively more sophisticated. For more
information see <a href="creatinggui.html">Creating
Your Organ GUI</a>.</p>
<p>GUIs can be made quickly and simply by using the images that come
built into the GrandOrgue software. This may be all that is necessary
if you plan to use your organ predominantly from an organ console
that sends MIDI messages for key-presses, stop activation, expression
pedals, and combination pistons. In that case the GUI does not need
to be visually appealing, and can even skip things like couplers and
combination setting buttons, since GrandOrgue already comes with
auxiliary panels with these elements defined. An example using the
built in images is:<img src="images/goodfhelp5_html_55669f0627582d98.png" name="Image3" align="left" width="1493" height="849">

</p>
<p>Notice that the Pedals and keys are very simple, but functional
(you can press on them with your mouse and activate a note.) There
are choices for the color and layout of the keyboards and pedals, and
the graphic used for stop knobs and buttons. There are built in
labels to label stop columns, and simple or completely free form
means of positioning them. Even if you choose the built in images, it
is still possible to add non-functioning images such as a picture of
the organ facade, or of a makerâ€™s label</p>
<p>If you are planning to use the GUI to operate your organ, you can
still use the built in images, but you might, for example, create new
panels for the left and right stop jams for use with two touch screen
monitors.</p>
<p>At the other end of complexity is a GUI with completely
customize-able elements. You might choose this if the organ you are
creating comes with images for keys, stops, couplers. It is fairly
simple to use custom images for stops, couplers, and buttons, but for
custom keyboards, the individual key graphics need to be precisely
placed. An example is shown below. Note that this example even
includes custom sliders in place of expression pedals.

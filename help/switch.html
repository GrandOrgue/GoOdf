<h1>Switches</h1>
<p>Switches are drawstop objects that, like stops, can have graphical drawstop
GUI element representations. However they do not reference ranks, but instead
are used to control stops, couplers, and tremulants using combinational
logic. Switches in turn can be controller by other switches using its
<b>Function </b>parameter and
referencing available switches as explained in <a href="stop.html">Stops.</a>

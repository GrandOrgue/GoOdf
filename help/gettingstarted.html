<h1>Getting Started</h1>
<p>GOODF is a Graphical User Interface(GUI) based program for
creating the Organ Definition file (ODF) used by the <a href="https://github.com/GrandOrgue/grandorgue">GrandOrgue</a>
sample based pipe organ simulator. The ODF file contains information
on which sample (.wav file) to play in response to the activation of
defined stops, couplers, and keyboard keys. It allows the definition
of windchestgroups on which to mount the pipes, and expression
controls to control volume, and tremulants to introduce a periodic
pitch and amplitude variation into the sample.</p>
<p>Finally, you can create one or more organ panels to display GUI
elements with which the organist interacts on one or more panels. Not
only Stops, Pistons, couplers. And keyboards, but also backgrounds,
pictures of the actual organ, and labels can be included. It is
possible to to define the look of each stop, coupler, button, and
keyboard using images you provide yourself, or you can use the
default images built into GrandOrgue.</p>
<p>All of these and more objects defined are defined within the ODF,
together with relationships between the objects.</p>
<p>For more information on what objects are available and what their
relationships are see the <a href="introduction.html">Introduction</a></p>
<p>For a brief description of the GOODF software, see the <a href="features.html">Features</a>
page</p>
<p>For an overview of the process used to create an ODF see the <a href="usinggoodf.html">Using
GOODF</a> page</p>
<p>Separate help pages are available for each of the objects used by
GrandOrgue</p>
<p>In the help text, <b>Bold</b> refers to the name of an object
parameter and <i>Italic</i> refers to the value of an object
parameter.</p>
<h2>General advice</h2>
<p>When using GOODF data is entered into data entry fields
(checkboxes or radio buttons for Boolean; numeric entry fields for
numbers, text entry boxes or pulldowns for text data or items with a
limited number of defined choices) This data will not be processed
and remembered unless you exit its data entry field. You cannot do
this by pressing the ENTER key, you need to use the TAB key, or click
on another data entry field or button within the same window In
particular, data will not take effect if you close a popup window
either with the Icons at the upper right provided by your operating
system or by clicking on an exit button. Data will not take effect if
you edit one object in its main editing window and then click on
another object without exiting the data entry field to which you made
changes

Manuals</h1>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>Manuals (including the pedals) are created for each division of
the organ. For floating divisions, a manual is created, but its GUI
element is not. In GOODF stops,couplers, and divisional objects are
created in the manual object as subsidiary objects, and they appear
under the manual in the object tree at the left of the GOODF window,
and once created, are edited independent of their manual. In addition
to couplers, independently created Tremulant and Switch objects can
be referenced in the manual editing window. The purpose of
referencing them here is so that divisional objects of this manual
can control them.</p>
<p>The manual editing window looks like this:</p>

<h2 class="western">Manual Parameter</h2>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p><b>Manual Name</b> is the name by which the manual is known, such
as Great, Hauptwerk, Positive, Swell, Choir, etc. It must be entered
here since its value can not be changed in its GUI element.</p>
<p><b>Number Of Logical Keys </b>(integer 1-192, required) Number of
keys on this manual (including non-playable ones). None playable keys
are accessed with sub and super intramanual couplers</p>
<p><b>First Accessible Key LogicalKeyNumber </b>(integer 1 -
NumberOfLogicalKeys, required) number of the first usable key 
</p>
<p><b>First Accessible Key MIDI NoteNumber </b>(integer 0 - 127,
required) MIDI note number of the first MIDI accessible key. 
</p>
<p><b>Number Of Accessible Keys </b>(integer 0 - 85, required) number
of MIDI accessible keys. 
</p>
<p><b>Midi Input Number (</b><span style="font-weight: normal">integer
0 - 200, default: 0) This number is used while building the initial
MIDI configuration to map the manual object to what MIDI device the
the user has set for the respective pedal/manual. 0 means no
association. 1 maps to pedal, 2 to first manual, 3 to second manual
etc. NOTE: the GUI only allows the association of the first few
manuals. Second touch manuals can be set to the same number as the
main manual as the user then only has to configure the low velocity
to make it work. </span>
</p>
<p><font color="#000000"><b>MIDI key map key</b><span style="font-weight: normal">:
This allows a key on the manual to be mapped to a different Midi note
number than its default. Use the pulldown to select the key, then use
</span><b>maps to value</b> <span style="font-weight: normal">to
select the new midi note to which it responds. You can repeat using
the pulldown for as many keys as you wish to remap</span></font></p>
